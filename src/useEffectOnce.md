This code defines a custom React hook named `useEffectOnce`. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Imports**:
   - `EffectCallback, useEffect`: Imported from `react`. 
     - `useEffect` is a React hook that performs side effects in function components.
     - `EffectCallback` is the type for the callback function that is passed to `useEffect`.

2. **useEffectOnce Hook**:
   - The hook takes a single argument, `effect`, which is a function of type `EffectCallback`.
   - Within the hook, `useEffect` is invoked with the given `effect` and an empty dependency array (`[]`). The empty dependency array means that the effect will run only once, similar to the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method in class components.
   
3. **Export**:
   - The `useEffectOnce` hook is exported as the default export of the module.

### Usage:

The purpose of this hook is to provide a concise way to run a side effect only once when the component mounts and not on subsequent re-renders.

You might use it in a component like this:

```javascript
import useEffectOnce from './path-to-useEffectOnce';

function MyComponent() {
  useEffectOnce(() => {
    console.log("This will only run once when the component mounts.");
  });

  return <div>My Component</div>;
}
```

By using `useEffectOnce`, you achieve the same effect as using `useEffect` with an empty dependency array, but with a more descriptive and self-explanatory name.
