This code provides a set of utility functions and constants. Let's break it down:

1. **noop**:
   - This is a "no-operation" function that does nothing when invoked. It's commonly used as a default or placeholder function.

2. **on**:
   - A utility function to safely add event listeners to objects. 
   - It takes in an object (`obj`), which can be a `Window`, `Document`, `HTMLElement`, or `EventTarget`. 
   - The rest of the arguments are spread (`...args`) and are expected to be the parameters for the `addEventListener` method.
   - The function checks if the object is not null and if the `addEventListener` method exists on it. If both conditions are met, it adds the event listener.

3. **off**:
   - Similar to the `on` function, but this utility function safely removes event listeners from objects.
   - It checks if the object is not null and if the `removeEventListener` method exists on it. If both conditions are met, it removes the event listener.

4. **isBrowser**:
   - A constant that checks if the code is running in a browser environment. It determines this by checking if the `window` object is defined.
   - If `isBrowser` is `true`, it means the code is executing in a browser. If `false`, it could be running on the server (e.g., during server-side rendering) or another environment.

5. **isNavigator**:
   - Similar to `isBrowser`, but this constant checks if the `navigator` object is defined.
   - The `navigator` object contains information about the browser and is typically available in browser environments.

### Usage:

These utilities can be used to safely interact with browser-specific objects and methods, ensuring that code doesn't throw errors if it accidentally runs in environments where these objects aren't available (like server-side rendering).

For example, to add an event listener to a button:

```javascript
import { on } from './path-to-utilities';

const button = document.querySelector("#myButton");
on(button, 'click', (e) => {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
});
```

By using the `on` utility, you can ensure that the event listener is only added if the button actually exists and supports the `addEventListener` method.
